# Hospital-Performance-Analysis
CMS HCAHPS survey data and quality comparison data from 2016 to 2020 for 4,944 hospitals was explored to find the relationship between performance indicators and patient experience and how these factors relate to hospital type. 
This analysis was from CMS HCAHPS survey data and quality comparison data from 2016 to 2020 for 4,944 hospitals. 
I cleaned the data using Power Query including separating quality and patient satisfaction data into separate tables and removing unnecessary duplicates from quality data to reduce space usage and improve performance. The footnote columns were noted and removed, and appropriate values were replaced according to the data requirements. Some rows were removed to focus analysis on the star rating of patient experience measures rather than specific questions. Data where only a few patients were eligible or responded, and where data was unavailable were exempted from analysis. After cleaning, a relationship was created between the facility ID of both data.
